%usage: [pmatrix, Fmatrix] = matrix_circ_wwtest(alpha1,alpha2,[ITCthreshold])
%Matrix version of the circ_wwtest function from the circstats toolbox,
%adapted for our purposes. alpha1 and alpha 2 are matrices of identical
%dimensions, except for the last one, representing the trial number in each
%of 2 experimental conditions. Matrix entries are complex numbers, whose
%phase distributions are compared across the 2 conditions. Two result
%matrices are returned, one with the p-value, the other with the
%corresponding F statistic. These matrices have one less dimension than the
%input matrices.
%The circular Watson-Williams test is only defined for phase distributions
%of non-zero concentration. To prevent unreliable results, a criterion
%ITCthreshold is applied to the mean resultant vector length across the two
%conditions, rw > ITCthreshold * ITCbaseline,
%where ITCbaseline is the expected ITC from a uniform distribution. This
%criterion is arbitrary, and can mask significant phase differences when
%too conservative, or generate spurious results when too liberal. The
%default value is ITCthreshold=2. Try changing this value when the function 
%returns illogical results.

%rw is the mean of the resultant vector length for the 2 conditions
