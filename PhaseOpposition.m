%Usage: [p_circWW, p_POS, p_zPOS] = PhaseOpposition(data1, data2, [nperm], [circww_ITCthreshold])
%Computes p-values of phase opposition for a dataset using 2 methods, the
%circular Watson-Williams test and the phase opposition sum. For the
%latter, two statistical procedures are employed, a standard permutation
%test and a hybrid test using the mean and standard deviation of the null
%distribution obtained from the permutations to derive a z-score and,
%finally, a more precise p-value.
%The function operates on N-dimensional matrices of complex numbers.
%If data1/2 contain non-unit norm complex numbers, they will be normalized
%If data1/2 contain only real numbers, we assume that they represent phase
%angle (in radians).
%The function operates on the last (Nth) dimension, representing trials.
%Trials in data1 are associated with one task outcome, and in data2 with
%another task outcome. The first N-1 dimensions may represent
%anything, most likely time, frequency (obtained from any time-frequency
%transform) and electrodes/channels.
%
%For datasets with multiple subjects (and likely different trial numbers, 
%run this function for each subject and combine the resulting maps of 
%p-values using the function combine_pvalues (included in this folder).
%
%Inputs:
%   -data1: N-dimensional matrix of complex phase values or real angles (in
%   radians) for trial group 1
%   -data2: N-dimensional matrix of complex phase values or real angles (in
%   radians) for trial group 2
%   -[nperm]: number of permutations for non-parametric (POS) test
%   [default 1000]
%   -[circww_ITCthreshold]: minimum ITC criterion used by the circular WW
%   test to reject inappropriate data. Try changing this value when getting
%   illogical results [default 3]
%
%Outputs:
%   -p_circWW: N-1-dimensional matrix of p-values obtained from the
%   circular Watson-Williams test
%   -p_POS: N-1-dimensional matrix of p-values obtained from the POS
%   measure and a comparison with a surrogate distribution of permutations
%   -p_zPOS: N-1-dimensional matrix of p-values obtained from the POS
%   measure and a zscore against the surrogate distribution of permutations
